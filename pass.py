Pass keyword is used as a placeholder.When the user does not know what code to write, So user simply places a pass at that line. 
Sometimes, the pass is used when the user doesnâ€™t want any code to execute.
So users can simply place a pass where empty code is not allowed, like in loops, function definitions, class definitions, or in if statements. 
So using a pass statement user avoids this error.
